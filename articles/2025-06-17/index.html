            <html><body><p>As we enter the dog days of summer, there are plenty of interesting telescope targets overhead—especially near the galactic core. Yet, for most of us, who live in light polluted areas, the true most special time of year for stargazing belongs to the winter months. From October to March, most of the world is treated to a night sky dominated by the Winter Hexagon—a dazzling patch of bright stars visible to the naked eye from even the most light polluted areas. The winter of 2024, however, was even more special than most. Both Mars and Jupiter shone bright amongst the Winter Hexagon, a rare alignment that augmented the splendor of the night sky. Now, in the middle of June, it has been months since we've been able to enjoy that night sky. Castor and Pollux were the last of the winter stars to disappear below the evening horizon just weeks ago.</p>
<p>This article will discuss what made those months of late 2024 and early 2025 so special, and will also include some images of the period to savor the past.</p>
<h3 id="the-winter-hexagon">The Winter Hexagon</h3>
<p>When compared to the other dense regions of the night sky—the galactic core, the Carina area, and the Summer Triangle—the Winter Hexagon remains the most splendid of them all. It contains 7 of the 20 brightest stars in the night sky! These stars are Sirius, Procyon, Pollux, Capella, Aldebaran, and Rigel, which are the vertices of the hexagon asterism, and Betelgeuse, which sits in the center of the hexagon. In addition to those stars, the region of the sky also includes an incredible 9 stars magnitude 2.0 or brighter: Castor, Menkalinan, Elnath, Alhena, Mirzam, Saiph, Alnitak, Alnilam, and Bellatrix. And it's not just its stars that make the Winter Hexagon special—it is also known for its well-known star formations like Orion's Belt, the "twin stars" (Castor and Pollux), and some of the most spectacular naked-eye deep sky objects like the Orion Nebula and the Hyades Cluster.</p>

<p>The Winter Hexagon is special because it has the capability to inspire everyone across the globe to love astronomy. Its 16 stars brighter than magnitude 2.0 stand out in even the most light-polluted city skies, all the while appearing overwhelmingly bright in dark skies. Its furthest south star—Sirius—sits at -16° declination, and its northernmost star is located 46° north, ultimately meaning that over 95% of the world's population is positioned to see the entire hexagon during the winter months. Personally, I find that the winter is the easiest time to convince people to stare up at the night sky, as people are often taken aback by how full of stars the sky suddenly appears.</p>
<p>Its many bright stars, asterisms, and deep-sky objects, however, were not the full story of the Winter Hexagon of 2024 to 2025. When one would think the already-spectacular region of the sky could not grow in significance, last winter saw it gaining two temporary members that outshone its brightest stars. The planets Jupiter and Mars, shining at incredible magnitudes of -2.5 and -1.4 (when compared to Sirius'  -1.46) thanks to well-timed oppositions, lurked along the edge of the hexagon. Mars appeared next to Castor and Pollux, turning the twin stars into triplets, and Jupiter sat next to Aldebaran. These bonus members of the winter night sky made for a truly special few months of stargazing.</p>

<p>The Sun is currently positioned dead in the center of the Winter Hexagon, meaning we won't see it for another few months. I am looking forward to its return this winter, although we'll have to wait for two winters from now to see both Mars and Jupiter return to the winter skies, near opposition once again.</p>
