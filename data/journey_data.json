I would be able to zoom into those photos and see more stars than ever before.\nWhile my phone was able to cut through my neighborhood’s light pollution and show me the unfettered night sky, I longed to see the same view with my own eyes.",

Having recently learned of the Bortle scale, I knew that I would be distant enough from civilization to be situated in a Bortle 3 zone—an area with skies dark enough to see the Milky Way and thousands of stars.\nWhen the Sun set that evening, I could not keep my eyes off the sky until the Milky Way came into view.\nEarlier that day, I had downloaded Stellarium, a stargazing app, on my phone. While exploring the app after the night was underway, I noticed a large oval on the screen labeled “M31”. Clicking it, I realized the oval was marking where to find the Andromeda Galaxy in the sky. I was impressed that the app included such arcane celestial objects in its representation of the night sky, though it seemed obvious that I would never see distant galaxies firsthand. Yet when I trained my eyes between Mirach and Schedar, I saw it. A faint but noticeable +smudge of light+(2) in the sky.\nOnly later did it truly hit me—that smudge of light was an entire galaxy, a behemoth. Billions of stars, worlds colliding, coalescing, and possibly harboring life, humbly lurking overhead as nothing more than a gentle, soft patch of light. Wow.",
